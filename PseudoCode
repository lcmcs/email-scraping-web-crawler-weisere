Create email class
    should contain int emailID, TimeStamp timestamp, String Emailaddress, String url
    add setters and getter
Create scrapeURL class
    contains a String url, List<Email> emailList, List<String> urlList
    has method called scrapeLinksAndEmails()
      gets url using jsoup and adds all urls to urlList 
      gets email using Jsoup and creates an Email object with the address, url, current time. adds it to the emailList
    has getters for email and url list
Create saveToDatabase class
    has one method saveToDB()
        takes a List<Email> and saves it to the database all in one shot

Above are all the classes needed to actually scrape now will need to make the main webscrape application

WebScraper (Main)
  make a taskQueue that will be initilized with a scrapeURL class with Touro.edu
  have a List<Email> allEmailList that will store emails
  have it pull first task from queue and run the scrapeLinksAndEmails() and using getter take the emailList
  and add it to the allEmailList 
  Then using the getter for urlList make the urls attatched to a scrapeURL object and add all of them into the taskQueue
  as future tasks so can be repeated
  when allEmailList reaches a certain number (length) lets say 1,000 send the list to the database using
  the saveToDataBase object and clear the list
  repeat 10 times (10,000 emails scraped and sent to database)
  make sure to have logging statments and a bunch of try catchs to avoid errors and enable debugiing
